## Description

In terms of functionality, this project can be seen as a **reference** for testing
the Setup, Toolchain  and Debugging. 

This is a simple example using on-chip RAM as memory. Compared to the original
blinky example, not the value of the counter but a running light is displayed
on the LEDs. 

The description for the original blinky can be found [here](https://github.com/emb4fun/neorv32/tree/master/setups/quartus/de0-nano-test-setup). 

## Credits
All credit must go to Stephan Nolting who has providing the [NEORV32](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32) project. I've only made minor changes against the original blinky project here.
