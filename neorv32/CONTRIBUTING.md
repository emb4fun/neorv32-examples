## Contributing Process

Here is a simple guide line if you'd like to contribute code modifications to this project:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/fork) this repository and clone the fork
2. Create a feature branch in your fork: `git checkout -b awesome_new_feature_branch`
3. Create a new remote for the upstream repo: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32`
4. Commit your modifications: `git commit -m "Awesome new feature!"`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin awesome_new_feature_branch`
6. Create a new [pull request](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/pulls); please make sure that your feature branch is up-to-date
with the project's `main` branch; we will review it as soon as possible
7. If you like, discuss / show-case your work on the project's [discussion board](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/discussions)

If your merge request modifies the code base in a significant way (something more than just a comment typo fix :wink:) please also update
the version identifier (increment the least-significant number) and add an according change log entry
(see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for more information).
