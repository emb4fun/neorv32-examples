**Theory of Operation**

The general purpose timer module provides a simple yet universal 32-bit timer. The timer is implemented if
`IO_GPTMR_EN` top generic is set `true`. It provides a 32-bit counter register (`COUNT`) and a 32-bit threshold
register (`THRES`). An interrupt is generated whenever the value of the counter registers matches the one from
threshold register.

The timer is enabled by setting the `GPTMR_CTRL_EN` bit in the device's control register `CTRL`. The `COUNT`
register will start incrementing at a programmable rate, which scales the main processor clock. The
pre-scaler value is configured via the three `GPTMR_CTRL_PRSCx` control register bits:

|=======================
| **`GPTMR_CTRL_PRSCx`**      | `0b000` | `0b001` | `0b010` | `0b011` | `0b100` | `0b101` | `0b110` | `0b111`
| Resulting `clock_prescaler` |       2 |       4 |       8 |      64 |     128 |    1024 |    2048 |    4096
|=======================

The timer provides two operation modes that are configured via the `GPTMR_CTRL_MODE` control register bit:
.If `GPTMR_CTRL_MODE` is cleared (`0`) the timer operates in _single-shot mode_. As soon as `COUNT` matches
`THRES` an interrupt request is generated and the timer stops operation (i.e. it stops incrementing)
.If `GPTMR_CTRL_MODE` is set (`1`) the timer operates in _continuous mode_. When `COUNT` matches `THRES` an interrupt
request is generated and `COUNT` is automatically reset to all-zero before continuing to increment.

[NOTE]
Disabling the timer will not clear the `COUNT` register. However, it can be manually reset at any time by
writing zero to it.


**Timer Interrupt**

The GPTMR interrupt is triggered when the timer is enabled and `COUNT` matches `THRES`. The interrupt
remains pending inside the CPU until it explicitly cleared by writing zero to the according <<_mip>> CSR bit.
