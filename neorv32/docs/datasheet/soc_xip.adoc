**Overview**

The execute in-place (XIP) module allows to execute code (and read constant data) directly from an external SPI flash memory.
The standard serial peripheral interface (SPI) is used as transfer protocol.

From the CPU side, the modules provides two different interfaces: one for transparently accessing the XIP flash and another
one for accessing the module's control and status registers. The first interface provides a _transparent_
gateway to the SPI flash, so the CPU can directly fetch and execute instructions (and/or read constant _data_).
Note that this interface is read-only. Any write access will raise a bus error exception.
The second interface is mapped to the processor's IO space and allows data accesses to the XIP module's
configuration registers.

.XIP Address Mapping
[NOTE]
When XIP mode is enabled the flash is mapped to fixed address space region starting at address
`0xE0000000` (see section <<_address_space>>).

.XIP Example Program
[TIP]
An example program is provided in `sw/example/demo_xip` that illustrate how to program and configure
an external SPI flash to run a program from it.


**SPI Protocol**

The XIP module accesses external flash using the standard SPI protocol. The module always sends data MSB-first and
provides all of the standard four clock modes (0..3), which are configured via the `XIP_CTRL_CPOL` (clock polarity)
and `XIP_CTRL_CPHA` (clock phase) control register bits, respectively. The clock speed of the interface (`xip_clk_o`)
is defined by a three-bit clock pre-scaler configured using the `XIP_CTRL_PRSCx` bits:

.XIP prescaler configuration
[cols="<4,^1,^1,^1,^1,^1,^1,^1,^1"]
[options="header",grid="rows"]
|=======================
| **`XIP_CTRL_PRSCx`**        | `0b000` | `0b001` | `0b010` | `0b011` | `0b100` | `0b101` | `0b110` | `0b111`
| Resulting `clock_prescaler` |       2 |       4 |       8 |      64 |     128 |    1024 |    2048 |    4096
|=======================

Based on the clock configuration the actual XIP SPI clock frequency f~XIP~ is derived from the processor's
main clock f~main~ and is determined by:

_**f~XIP~**_ = _f~main~[Hz]_ / (2 * `clock_prescaler`)

Hence, the maximum XIP clock speed is f~main~ / 4.

.High-Speed SPI mode
[TIP]
The module provides a "high-speed" SPI mode. In this mode the clock prescaler configuration (`XIP_CTRL_PRSCx`) is ignored
and the SPI clock operates at f~main~ / 2 (half of the processor's main clock). High speed SPI mode is enabled by setting
the control register's `XIP_CTRL_HIGHSPEED` bit.

The flash's "read command", which initiates a read access, is defined by the `XIP_CTRL_RD_CMD` control register bits.
For most SPI flash memories this is `0x03` for normal SPI mode.


**Direct SPI Access**

The XIP module allows to initiate _direct_ SPI transactions. This feature can be used to configure the attached SPI
flash or to perform direct read and write accesses to the flash memory. Two data registers `DATA_LO` and
`DATA_HI` are provided to send up to 64-bit of SPI data. The `DATA_HI` register is write-only,
so a total of just 32-bits of receive data is provided. Note that the module handles the chip-select
line (`xip_csn_o`) by itself so it is not possible to construct larger consecutive transfers.

The actual data transmission size in bytes is defined by the control register's `XIP_CTRL_SPI_NBYTES` bits.
Any configuration from 1 byte to 8 bytes is valid. Other value will result in unpredictable behavior.

Since data is always transferred MSB-first, the data in `DATA_HI:DATA_LO` also has to be MSB-aligned. Receive data is
available in `DATA_LO` only since `DATA_HI` is write-only. Writing to `DATA_HI` triggers the actual SPI transmission.
The `XIP_CTRL_PHY_BUSY` control register flag indicates a transmission being in progress.

The chip-select line of the XIP module (`xip_csn_o`) will only become asserted (enabled, pulled low) if the
`XIP_CTRL_SPI_CSEN` control register bit is set. If this bit is cleared, `xip_csn_o` is always disabled
(pulled high).

[NOTE]
Direct SPI mode is only possible when the module is enabled (setting `XIP_CTRL_EN`) but **before** the actual
XIP mode is enabled via `XIP_CTRL_XIP_EN`.

[TIP]
When the XIP mode is not enabled, the XIP module can also be used as additional general purpose SPI controller
with a transfer size of up to 64 bits per transmission.


**Using the XIP Mode**

The XIP module is globally enabled by setting the `XIP_CTRL_EN` bit in the device's `CTRL` control register.
Clearing this bit will reset the whole module and will also terminate any pending SPI transfer.

Since there is a wide variety of SPI flash components with different sizes, the XIP module allows to specify
the address width of the flash: the number of address bytes used for addressing flash memory content has to be
configured using the control register's _XIP_CTRL_XIP_ABYTES_ bits. These two bits contain the number of SPI
address bytes (**minus one**). For example for a SPI flash with 24-bit addresses these bits have to be set to
`0b10`.

The transparent XIP accesses are transformed into SPI transmissions with the following format (starting with the MSB):

* 8-bit command: configured by the `XIP_CTRL_RD_CMD` control register bits ("SPI read command")
* 8 to 32 bits address: defined by the `XIP_CTRL_XIP_ABYTES` control register bits ("number of address bytes")
* 32-bit data: sending zeros and receiving the according flash word (32-bit)

Hence, the maximum XIP transmission size is 72-bit, which has to be configured via the `XIP_CTRL_SPI_NBYTES`
control register bits. Note that the 72-bit transmission size is only available in XIP mode. The transmission
size of the direct SPI accesses is limited to 64-bit.

[NOTE]
When using four SPI flash address bytes, the most significant 4 bits of the address are always hardwired
to zero allowing a maximum **accessible** flash size of 256MB.

[NOTE]
The XIP module always fetches a full naturally aligned 32-bit word from the SPI flash. Any sub-word data masking
or alignment will be performed by the CPU core logic.

[IMPORTANT]
The XIP mode requires the 4-byte data words in the flash to be ordered in **little-endian** byte order.

After the SPI properties (including the amount of address bytes **and** the total amount of SPI transfer bytes)
and XIP address mapping are configured, the actual XIP mode can be enabled by setting
the control register's `XIP_CTRL_XIP_EN` bit. This will enable the "transparent SPI access port" of the module and thus,
the _transparent_ conversion of access requests into proper SPI flash transmissions. Hence, any access to the processor's
memory-mapped XIP region (`0xE0000000` to `0xEFFFFFFF`) will be converted into SPI flash accesses.
Make sure `XIP_CTRL_SPI_CSEN` is also set so the module can actually select/enable the attached SPI flash.
No more direct SPI accesses via `DATA_HI:DATA_LO` are possible when the XIP mode is enabled. However, the
XIP mode can be disabled at any time.

[NOTE]
If the XIP module is disabled (_XIP_CTRL_EN_ = `0`) any accesses to the memory-mapped XIP flash address region
will raise a bus access exception. If the XIP module is enabled (_XIP_CTRL_EN_ = `1`) but XIP mode is not enabled
yet (_XIP_CTRL_XIP_EN_ = '0') any access to the programmed XIP memory segment will also raise a bus access exception.

[TIP]
It is highly recommended to enable the <<_processor_internal_instruction_cache_icache>> to cover some
of the SPI access latency.


**XIP Burst Mode**

By default, every XIP access to the flash transmits the read command and the word-aligned address before reading four consecutive
data bytes. Obviously, this introduces a certain transmission overhead. To reduces this overhead, the XIP mode allows to utilize
the flash's _incrmental read_ function, which will return consecutive bytes when continuing to send clock cycles after a read command.
Hence, the XIP module provides an optional "burst mode" to accelerate consecutive read accesses.

The XIP burst mode is enabled by setting the `XIP_CTRL_BURST_EN` bit in the module's control register. The burst mode only affects
the actual XIP mode and _not_ the direct SPI mode. Hence, it should be enabled right before enabling XIP mode only.
By using the XIP burst mode flash read accesses can be accelerated by up to 50%.
