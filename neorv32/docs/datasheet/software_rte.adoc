=== NEORV32 Runtime Environment

The NEORV32 software framework provides a minimal runtime environment ("RTE") that takes care of a stable
and _safe_ execution environment by providing a unified interface for handling of _all_ traps (exceptions and
interrupts). Once initialized, the RTE provides <<_default_rte_trap_handlers>> that catch all possible traps.
These default handlers just output a message via UART when a certain trap has been triggered. The default
handlers can be overridden by the application code to install application-specific handler functions for each trap.

Using the RTE is **optional but highly recommended** for bare-metal / non-OS applications. The RTE provides a
simple and comfortable way of delegating traps to application-specific handlers while making sure that all traps
(even though they are not explicitly used by the application) are handled correctly. Performance-optimized
applications or embedded operating systems may not use the RTE at all in order to increase response time.


==== RTE Operation

The RTE manages the trap-related CSRs of the CPU's privileged architecture (see <<_machine_trap_handling_csrs>>).
It initializes the <<_mtvec>> CSR in DIRECT mode, which provides the base entry point for _all_ traps. The address
stored to this register defines the address of the **first-level trap handler**, which is provided by the NEORV32
RTE. Whenever an exception or interrupt is triggered this first-level trap handler is executed.

The first-level handler performs a complete context save, analyzes the source of the trap and calls the according
**second-level trap handler**, which takes care of the actual exception/interrupt handling. The RTE manages an
internal look-up table to track the addresses of the according second-level trap handlers.

After the initial RTE setup, each entry in the RTE's trap handler look-up table is initialized with a
<<_default_rte_trap_handlers>>. These default handler do not execute any trap-related operations - they just output
a debugging message via the primary UART (UART0) (if enabled) to inform the user that a trap has occurred that is
not (yet) handled by a proper application-specific trap handler. After sending this message, the RTE tries to resume
normal execution by moving on to the next linear instruction.

.Dual-Core Configuration
[NOTE]
The RTE's internal trap handler look-up table is used globally for **both** cores. If a core-specific handling is
required, the according user-defined trap handler need to retrieve the core's ID from <<_mhartid>> and branch
accordingly.


==== Using the RTE

The NEORV32 runtime environment is part of the default NEORV32 software framework. The links to the according
software references are listed below.

|=======================

The RTE has to be explicitly enabled by calling the according setup function. It is recommended to do this right at the
beginning of the application's `main` function. For the SMP <<_dual_core_configuration>> the RTE setup functions has to
be called on each core that wants to use the RTE.

.RTE Setup Right at the Beginning of "main"
[source,c]
----
int main() {

  neorv32_rte_setup(); // setup NEORV32 runtime environment

  ...
----

After setup, all traps will trigger execution of the RTE's <<_default_rte_trap_handlers>> at first. In order to use
application-specific trap handlers the default debug handlers can be overridden by installing user-defined ones:

.Installing an Application-Specific Trap Handler (Function Prototype)
[source,c]
----
int neorv32_rte_handler_install(uint8_t id, void (*handler)(void));
----

The first argument `id` defines the "trap ID" (for example a certain interrupt request) that shall be handled by the
user-defined handler. These IDs are defined in `sw/lib/include/neorv32_rte.h`. However, more convenient device-specific
aliases are also defined in `sw/lib/include/neorv32.h`. The second argument `handler` is the actual function that
implements the user-defined trap handler. The custom handler functions must have a specific type without any arguments
and with no return value:

.Custom Trap Handler (Function Prototype)
[source,c]
----
void custom_trap_handler_xyz(void) {

  // handle trap...
}
----

.Custom Trap Handler Attributes
[IMPORTANT]
Do **NOT** use the `((interrupt))` attribute for the application trap handler functions! This would place an `mret`
instruction at the end of the handler making it impossible to return to the first-level trap handler of the RTE core.

.`mscratch` CSR
[IMPORTANT]
The <<_mscratch>> CSR should not be used inside an application trap handler as this register is used by the RTE to
provide the base address of the application's stack frame <<_application_context_handling>> (i.e. modifying the
registers of application code that caused a trap).

The following example shows how to install trap handlers for exemplary traps.

.Installing Custom Trap Handlers Examples
[source,c]
----
neorv32_rte_handler_install(RTE_TRAP_MTI, machine_timer_irq_handler); // handler for machine timer interrupt
neorv32_rte_handler_install(RTE_TRAP_MENV_CALL, environment_call_handler); // handler for machine environment call exception
neorv32_rte_handler_install(SLINK_RX_RTE_ID, slink_rx_handler); // handler for SLINK receive interrupt
----


==== Default RTE Trap Handlers

The default RTE trap handlers are executed when a certain trap is triggered that is not (yet) handled by an
application-defined trap handler. The default handler will output a message giving additional debug information
via the <<_primary_universal_asynchronous_receiver_and_transmitter_uart0>> to inform the user and it will also
try to resume normal program execution (exemplary RTE outputs are shown below). The specific message right at
the beginning of the debug trap handler message corresponds to the trap code obtained from the <<_mcause>> CSR
(see <<_neorv32_trap_listing>>).

In most cases the RTE can successfully continue operation - for example if it catches an **interrupt** request
that is not handled by the actual application program. However, if the RTE catches an un-handled **trap** like
a bus access fault exception, continuing execution will most likely fail making the CPU crash.

==== Application Context Handling

Upon trap entry the RTE backups the entire application context (i.e. all `x` general purpose registers) to the
stack. The context is restored automatically after trap completion. The base address of the according stack frame
is copied to the <<_mscratch>> CSR. By having this information available, the RTE provides dedicated functions
for accessing and altering the application context:

.RTE Context Access Functions
[source,c]
----
// Prototypes
uint32_t neorv32_rte_context_get(int x); // read register
void     neorv32_rte_context_put(int x, uint32_t data); // write data to register

// Examples
uint32_t tmp = neorv32_rte_context_get(9); // read register 'x9'
neorv32_rte_context_put(28, tmp); // write 'tmp' to register 'x28'
----

The `x` argument is used to specify one of the RISC-V general purpose register `x0` to `x31`. Note that registers
`x16` to `x31` are not available if the RISC-V <<_e_isa_extension>> is enabled. For he SMP <<_dual_core_configuration>>
the provided context functions will access the stack frame of the interrupted application code that was running
on the specific CPU core that caused the trap entry.

The context access functions can be used by application-specific trap handlers to _emulate_ unsupported
CPU / SoC features like unimplemented IO modules, unsupported instructions and even unaligned memory accesses.

A demo program, which showcases how to emulate unaligned memory accesses using the NEORV32 runtime environment
can be found in `sw/example/demo_emulate_unaligned`.
