| Top entity port:         | `mtime_irq_i` | RISC-V machine timer IRQ if internal one is **not** implemented
| Configuration generics:  | `IO_MTIME_EN` | implement machine timer when `true`
| CPU interrupts:          | `MTI` | machine timer interrupt (see <<_processor_interrupts>>)
|=======================

The MTIME module implements a memory-mapped MTIME machine system timer that is compatible to the RISC-V
privileged specifications. The 64-bit system time is accessed via the  memory-mapped `TIME_LO` and
`TIME_HI` registers. A 64-bit time compare register, which is accessible via the memory-mapped `TIMECMP_LO`
and `TIMECMP_HI` registers, can be used to configure the CPU's `MTI` (machine timer interrupt). The interrupt
is triggered whenever `TIME` (high & low part) is greater than or equal to `TIMECMP` (high & low part).
The interrupt remains active (=pending) until `TIME` becomes less `TIMECMP` again (either by modifying
`TIME` or `TIMECMP`).

.Reset
[NOTE]
After a hardware reset the `TIME` and `TIMECMP` register are reset to all-zero.

.External MTIME Interrupt
[IMPORTANT]
If the internal MTIME module is disabled (`IO_MTIME_EN` = `false`) the machine timer interrupt becomes available as external signal.
The `mtime_irq_i` signal is level-triggered and high-active. Once set the signal has to stay high until
the interrupt request is explicitly acknowledged (e.g. writing to a memory-mapped register).
