**Key Features**

* Up to 16 independent channels
* Per-channel configuration of duty cycle and carrier frequency
* 8-bit duty cycle resolution
* 3-bit (coarse) + 10-bit (fine) frequency resolution
* Configurable PWM polarity


**Overview**

The PWM module implements a pulse-width modulation controller with up to 16 independent channels. Duty cycle and
carrier frequency can be programmed individually for each channel.The total number of implemented channels is
defined by the `IO_PWM_NUM_CH` generic. The PWM output signal `pwm_o` has a static size of 16-bit. Channel 0
corresponds to bit 0, channel 1 to bit 1 and so on. If less than 16 channels are configured, only the LSB-aligned
channel bits are connected while the remaining ones are hardwired to zero.


**Theory of Operation**

Depending on the configured number channels, the PWM module provides 16 configuration registers `CHANNEL_CFG[0]` to
`CHANNEL_CFG[15]` - one for each channel. Regardless of the configuration of `IO_PWM_NUM_CH` all channel registers can
be accessed without raising an exception. However, registers above `IO_PWM_NUM_CH-1` are read-only and hardwired to
all-zero.

Each configuration provides a 1-bit enable flag to enable/disable the according channel, a 1-bit flag for setting the
channel polarity, an 8-bit register for setting the duty cycle and a 3-bit clock prescaler select as well as a 10-bit clock
diver for _coarse_ and _fine_ tuning of the carrier frequency, respectively.

A channel is enabled by setting the `PWM_CFG_EN` bit. If this bit is cleared the according PWM output is deasserted
(zero if channel polarity is not inverted, one if inverted). The duty cycle is programmed via the 8 `PWM_CFG_DUTY` bits.
Based on the value programmed to these bits the resulting duty cycle of the according channel can be computed by the
following formula:

_Duty Cycle_[%] = `PWM_CFG_DUTY` / 2^8^

The PWM period (carrier frequency) is derived from the processor's main clock (_f~main~_). The `PWM_CFG_PRSC` register
bits allow to select one out of eight pre-defined clock prescalers for a coarse clock scaling. The 10 `PWM_CFG_CDIV` register
bits can be used to apply another fine clock scaling.

The resulting PWM carrier frequency is defined by:

_f~PWM~_[Hz] = _f~main~_[Hz] / (2^8^ * `clock_prescaler` * (1 + `PWM_CFG_CDIV`))
