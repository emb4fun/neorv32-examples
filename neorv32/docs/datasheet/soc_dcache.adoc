|=======================

The processor features an optional data cache to improve performance when using memories with high
access latencies. The cache is directly connected to the CPU's data access interface and provides
full-transparent buffering.

The cache is implemented if the `DCACHE_EN` generic is `true`. The size of the cache memory is defined via the
`DCACHE_BLOCK_SIZE` (the size of a single cache block/page/line in bytes; has to be a power of two and greater than or
equal to 4 bytes) and `DCACHE_NUM_BLOCKS` (the total amount of cache blocks; has to be a power of two and greater than or
equal to 1) generics. The data cache provides only a single set, hence it is direct-mapped.


**Cached/Unached Accesses**

The data cache provides direct accesses (= uncached) to memory in order to access memory-mapped IO (like the
processor-internal IO/peripheral modules). All accesses that target the address range from `0xF0000000` to `0xFFFFFFFF`
will not be cached at all (see section <<_address_space>>).


.Caching Internal Memories
[NOTE]
The data cache is intended to accelerate data access to **processor-external** memories
(via the external bus interface or via the XIP module). The cache(s) should not be implemented
when using only processor-internal data and instruction memories.

.Manual Cache Clear/Reload
[NOTE]
By executing the `fence` instruction (<<_i_isa_extension>>) the cache is cleared and a reload from
main memory is triggered.

.Retrieve Cache Configuration from Software
[TIP]
Software can retrieve the cache configuration/layout from the <<_sysinfo_cache_configuration>> register.

.Bus Access Fault Handling
[NOTE]
The cache always loads a complete cache block (aligned to the block size) every time a
cache miss is detected. Each cached word from this block provides a single status bit that indicates if the
according bus access was successful or caused a bus error. Hence, the whole cache block remains valid even
if certain addresses inside caused a bus error. If the CPU accesses any of the faulty cache words, a
data bus error exception is raised.
