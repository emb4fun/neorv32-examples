|=======================

Implementation of the processor-internal instruction memory is enabled via the processor's
`MEM_INT_IMEM_EN` generic. The size in bytes is defined via the `MEM_INT_IMEM_SIZE` generic. If the
IMEM is implemented, the memory is mapped into the instruction memory space and located right at the
beginning of the instruction memory space (default `ispace_base_c` = 0x00000000), see <<_address_space>>.

By default the IMEM is implemented as true RAM so the content can be modified during run time. This is
required when using a bootloader that can update the content of the IMEM at any time. If you do not need
the bootloader anymore - since your application development has completed and you want the program to
permanently reside in the internal instruction memory - the IMEM is automatically implemented as _pre-intialized_
ROM when the processor-internal bootloader is disabled (`INT_BOOTLOADER_EN` = `false`).

When the IMEM is implemented as ROM, it will be initialized during synthesis with the actual application program
image. The compiler toolchain provides an option to generate and override the default VHDL initialization file
`rtl/core/neorv32_application_image.vhd`, which is automatically inserted into the IMEM. If the IMEM is implemented
as RAM (default), the memory will **not be initialized at all**.

.VHDL Source File
[NOTE]
The actual IMEM is split into two design files: a plain entity definition (`neorv32_imem.entity.vhd`) and the actual
architecture definition (`mem/neorv32_imem.default.vhd`). This **default architecture** provides a _generic_ and
_platform independent_ memory design that (should) infers embedded memory block. You can replace/modify the architecture
source file in order to use platform-specific features (like advanced memory resources) or to improve technology mapping
and/or timing.

.Read-Only Access
[NOTE]
If the IMEM is implemented as true ROM any write attempt to it will raise a _store access fault_ exception.
