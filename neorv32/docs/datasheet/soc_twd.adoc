**Key Features**

* Philips IÂ²C-compatible device-side controller
* Programmable 7-bit device address
* Optional RX/TX data FIFOs
* Programmable interrupt conditions


**Overview**

The NEORV32 TWD implements an I2C-compatible **device-side** interface. Processor-external I2C hosts can communicate
with this module by issuing I2C transactions. The TWD is entirely passive an only reacts on those external transmissions.

.Device-Mode Only
[NOTE]
The NEORV32 TWD controller only supports **device mode**. Transmission are initiated by processor-external modules
and not by an external TWD. If you are looking for a _host-mode_ module (transactions initiated by the processor)
check out the <<_two_wire_serial_interface_controller_twi>>.


**Theory of Operation**

The TWD module provides two memory-mapped registers that are used for configuration & status check (`CTRL`) and
for accessing transmission data (`DATA`). The `DATA` register is transparently buffered by separate RX and TX FIFOs.
The size of those FIFOs can be configured by the `IO_TWD_RX_FIFO` and `IO_TWD_TX_FIFO` generics. Software can determine
the FIFO size via the control register's `TWD_CTRL_FIFO_*` bits. The current status of the RX and TX FIFO can be polled
by software via the `TWD_CTRL_RX_*` and `TWD_CTRL_TX_*` flags.

The module is globally enabled by setting the control register's `TWD_CTRL_EN` bit. Clearing this bit will disable
and reset the entire module also clearing the internal RX and TX FIFOs. Each FIFO can also be cleared individually at
any time by setting `TWD_CTRL_CLR_RX` or `TWD_CTRL_CLR_TX` control register bits, respectively.

The external two wire bus is sampled and synchronized into the processor's clock domain with a sampling frequency of
1/8 of the processor's main clock. In order to increase the resistance to glitches the sampling frequency can be lowered
to 1/64 of the processor clock by setting the control register's `TWD_CTRL_FSEL` bit.

.Current Bus State
[TIP]
The current state of the I2C bus lines (SCL and SDA) can be checked by software via the `TWD_CTRL_SENSE_*` control
register bits. Note that the TWD module needs to be enabled in order to sample the bus state.

The TWD only responds to a single configurable 7bit device address that is programmed by the `TWD_CTRL_DEV_ADDR` bits.
Specific general-call or broadcast addresses are not supported.

Depending on the transaction type, data is either read from the RX FIFO and transferred to the host (**read operation**)
or data is received from the host and written to the TX FIFO (**write operation**).


**Read Operation: host reads data from TWD**

.TWD read operation timing (not to scale, split across two lines)
[wavedrom, format="svg", align="center"]
----
{signal: [
  {name: 'SDA', wave: '10.7..7..7..7..7..7..7..1..0..x|.', node: 'a.b.....................c..d..e', data: ['A6', 'A5', 'A4', 'A3', 'A2', 'A1', 'A0']},
  {name: 'SCL', wave: '1.0.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.|.'},
  {},
  {name: 'SDA', wave: 'x|.9..9..9..9..9..9..9..9..0..0.1', node: '...........................f..gh.i', data: ['D7', 'D6', 'D5', 'D4', 'D3', 'D2', 'D1', 'D0']},
  {name: 'SCL', wave: '0|..10.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.1.'}
 ],
   edge: [
    'a-b START',
    'c-d READ',
    'd-e ACK by TWD',
    'f-g ACK by HOST',
    'h-i STOP'
 ]
}
----

For a read operation the host first generates START or REPEATED-START condition. Then, the host transmits the 7 bit device
address (green signals `A6` to `A0`) plus the read-command bit. If the transferred address matches the one programmed to to
`TWD_CTRL_DEV_ADDR` control register bits the TWD module will response with an ACK by pulling the SDA bus line actively
low during the 9th SCL clock pulse. If there is no address match the TWD will not interfere with the bus and will wait for
the next START or REPEATED-START condition.

For the actual data transmission the host keeps the SDA line at high state while sending the clock pulses. The TWD will
read a byte from the internal TX FIFO and will transmit it MSB-first to the host. During the 9th clock pulse the host has
to acknowledged the transfer (ACK) by pulling SDA low. If no ACK is received by the TWD no data is taken from the TX FIFO
and the same byte is transmitted in the next data phase. If the TX FIFO becomes empty while the host keeps reading data,
all-one bytes are sent back to the host. The transaction is terminated by a STOP condition.


**Write Operation: host writes data to TWD**

{signal: [
  {name: 'SDA', wave: '10.7..7..7..7..7..7..7..0..0..x|.', node: 'a.b.....................c..d..e', data: ['A6', 'A5', 'A4', 'A3', 'A2', 'A1', 'A0']},
  {name: 'SCL', wave: '1.0.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.|.'},
  {},
  {name: 'SDA', wave: 'x|.5..5..5..5..5..5..5..5..0..0.1', node: '...........................f..gh.i', data: ['D7', 'D6', 'D5', 'D4', 'D3', 'D2', 'D1', 'D0']},
  {name: 'SCL', wave: '0|..10.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.10.1.'}
 ],
   edge: [
    'a-b START',
    'c-d WRITE',
    'd-e ACK by TWD',
    'f-g ACK by TWD',
    'h-i STOP'
 ]
}
----

For a write operation the host first generates START or REPEATED-START condition. Then, the host transmits the 7 bit device
address (green signals `A6` to `A0`) plus the write-command bit. If the transferred address matches the one programmed to to
`TWD_CTRL_DEV_ADDR` control register bits the TWD module will response with an ACK by pulling the SDA bus line actively
low during the 9th SCL clock pulse. If there is no address match the TWD will not interfere with the bus and will wait for
the next START or REPEATED-START condition.

For the actual data transmission the host sends the write-data MSB first together with the clock pulses. During the 9th clock
pulse the TWD will respond with an ACK by pulling SDA low. Note that the TWD will respond with a NACK if the RX FIFO is full.
The transaction is terminated by a STOP condition.


**Tristate Drivers**

The TWD module requires two tristate drivers (actually: open-drain drivers - signals can only be actively driven low) for
the SDA and SCL lines, which have to be implemented by the user in the setup's top module / IO ring. A generic VHDL example
is shown below (here, `sda_io` and `scl_io` are the actual TWD bus lines, which are of type `std_logic`).

.TWD Tristate Driver Example (VHDL)
[source,VHDL]
----
sda_io    <= '0' when (twd_sda_o = '0') else 'Z'; -- drive
scl_io    <= '0' when (twd_scl_o = '0') else 'Z'; -- drive
twd_sda_i <= std_ulogic(sda_io); -- sense
twd_scl_i <= std_ulogic(scl_io); -- sense
----


**TWD Interrupt**

The TWD module provides a single interrupt to signal certain FIFO conditions to the CPU. The control register's
`TWD_CTRL_IRQ_*` bits are used to enabled individual interrupt conditions. Note that all enabled conditions are
logically OR-ed.

* `TWD_CTRL_IRQ_RX_AVAIL`: trigger interrupt if at least one data byte is available in the RX FIFO
* `TWD_CTRL_IRQ_RX_FULL`: trigger interrupt if the RX FIFO is completely full
* `TWD_CTRL_IRQ_TX_EMPTY`: trigger interrupt if the TX FIFO is empty

The interrupt remains active until all enabled interrupt-causing conditions are resolved.
The interrupt can only trigger if the module is actually enabled (`TWD_CTRL_EN` is set).
