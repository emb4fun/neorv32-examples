== Zephyr RTOS Support

The NEORV32 processor is supported by upstream Zephyr RTOS: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/riscv/neorv32/doc/index.html

[IMPORTANT]
The absolute path to the NEORV32 executable image generator binary (`.../neorv32/sw/image_gen`) has to be added to the `PATH` variable
so the Zephyr build system can generate executables and memory-initialization images.

[NOTE]
