== Packaging the Processor as Vivado IP Block

Packaging the entire processor as IP module allows easy integration of the core (or even several cores)
into a block-design-based Vivado project. The NEORV32 repository provides a full-scale TCL script that
automatically packages the processor as Vivado IP block including an interactive configuration GUI.
For this, a specialized wrapper for the processor's top entity is provided
(`rtl/system_integration/neorv32_vivado_ip.vhd`) that features AXI4 (via XBUS)
and AXI4-Stream (via SLINK) compatible interfaces.

.General AXI Wrapper
[NOTE]
The provided AXI4-bridge can also be used for custom (AXI) setups outside of Vivado and/or IP block designs.

Besides packaging the HDL modules, the TCL script also generates an interactive customization GUI that allows an easy
and intuitive configuration of the processor. The rather complex VHDL configuration generics are abstracted and provided
with tool tips to make it easier to understand the different configuration options.

The following steps show how to package the processor using the provided TCL script
(`neorv32/rtl/system_integration/neorv32_vivado_ip.tcl`)
and how to import the generated IP block into the Vivado IP repository.

**Packaging from within a Vivado Project** (recommended)

[start=1]
. Open your Vivado block design.
. Open the TCL shell ("Window -> Tcl Console") to manually invoke the script.
. Use `cd` in the TCL console to navigate to the project's `neorv32/rtl/system_integration` folder.
. Execute `source neorv32_vivado_ip.tcl` in the TCL console.
. A second Vivado instance will open automatically packaging the IP module. After this process is completed, the second Vivado instance will automatically close again.
. A new folder `neorv32_vivado_ip_work` is created in `neorv32/rtl/system_integration` which contains the IP-packaging Vivado project.
. The `packaged_ip` sub-folder provides the actual IP module which is automatically added to the project's IP repository.
. You will find the NEORV32 in the "User Repository" section of the Vivado IP catalog.

**Stand-Alone Packaging**

[start=1]
. Start Vivado.
. On the splash screen select "Tools -> Run TCL Script".
. Navigate to the `neorv32/rtl/system_integration` folder and select `neorv32_vivado_ip.tcl`.
. A second Vivado instance will open automatically packaging the IP module. After this process is completed, the second Vivado instance will automatically close again.
. A new folder `neorv32_vivado_ip_work` is created in `neorv32/rtl/system_integration` which contains the IP-packaging Vivado project.
. The `packaged_ip` sub-folder provides the actual IP module.
. Open your custom design where you want to integrate the NEORV32 IP module.
. Click on "Settings" in the "Project Manager" on the left side.
. Under "Project Settings" expand the "IP" section and click on "Repository".
. Click the large plus button and select the previously generated IP folder (`path/to/neorv32/rtl/system_integration/neorv32_vivado_ip_work/packaged_ip`).
. Click "Select" and close the Settings menu with "Apply" and "OK".
. You will find the NEORV32 in the "User Repository" section of the Vivado IP catalog.

.Combinatorial Loops DRC Errors
[WARNING]
If the TRNG is enabled it is recommended to add the following commands to the project's constraints file in order
to prevent DRC errors during bitstream generation.

.Allow Combinatorial Loops
[source,xdc]
----
set_property SEVERITY {warning} [get_drc_checks LUTLP-1]
set_property IS_ENABLED FALSE [get_drc_checks LUTLP-1]
set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE
----

.Re-Packaging the IP Core
[NOTE]
For every change that is made to the hardware RTL code (excluding configuration made via the customization GUI)
the NEORV32 IP module needs to be re-packaged by re-executing the packing script (`neorv32_vivado_ip.tcl`). +
 +
This also applies if an executable installed right into the IMEM shall be updated. It is **not** possible to replace the IMEM image
(`neorv32_application_image.vhd`) file in the packaged_ip folder. For the Vivado design suite, the new program to be executed must
be compiled and installed using the `install` makefile target. Next, the `neorv32_vivado_ip.tcl` script has to be executed again.
Finally, Vivado will prompt to upgrade the NEORV32 IP.

.Out-of-Context Synthesis
[IMPORTANT]
If NEORV32 configurations do not take effect, try using the out-of-context synthesis option.

. Incremental Compilation of Simulation Sources (ISIM)
[IMPORTANT]
When using AMD Vivado (ISIM for simulation) make sure to **TURN OFF** "incremental compilation" (_Project Setting_
-> _Simulation_ -> _Advanced_ -> _Enable incremental compilation). This will slow down simulation relaunch but will
ensure that all application images (`*_image.vhd`) are reanalyzed when recompiling the NEORV32 application or bootloader.
