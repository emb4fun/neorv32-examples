== LiteX SoC Builder Support

https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex[LiteX] is a SoC builder framework by https://github.com/enjoy-digital[Enjoy-Digital]
that allows easy creation of complete system-on-chip designs - including sophisticated interfaces like Ethernet, serial ATA
and DDR memory controller. The NEORV32 has been ported to the LiteX framework to be used as central processing unit.

The default microcontroller-like NEORV32 processor is not directly supported as all the peripherals would provide some _redundancy_.
Instead, the LiteX port uses a _core complex wrapper_ that only includes the actual NEORV32 CPU, the instruction cache (optional),
the RISC-V machine system timer (optional), the on-chip debugger (optional) and the internal bus infrastructure.
The specific implementation of optional modules as well as RISC-V ISA configuration and performance optimization options are
controlled by a single _CONFIGURATION_ option wrapped in the LiteX build flow. The Wishbone interface is used to with the
other LiteX SoC parts.

.Core Complex Wrapper
[TIP]
The NEORV32 core complex wrapper used by LiteX for integration can be found in
`rtl/system_integration/neorv32_litex_core_complex.vhd`.

.LiteX NEORV32 Documentation
[TIP]
More information can be found in the "NEORV32" section of the LiteX project wiki: https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/CPUs

LiteX: external interrupt - the "RISC-V machine external interrupt" is not supported by the LiteX port yet


=== LiteX Setup

[start=1]
. Install LiteX and the RISC-V compiler following the excellent quick start guide: https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki#quick-start-guide
. The NEORV32 port for LiteX uses GHDL and yosys for converting the VHDL files via the https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin[GHDL-yosys-plugin].
You can download prebuilt packages for example from https://github.com/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain, which is _no longer maintained. It is superdesed
by https://github.com/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain.
. _EXPERIMENTAL:_ GHDL provides a https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/using/Synthesis.html[synthesis options], which converts a VHDL setup into a plain-Verilog
netlist module (not tested on LiteX yet). Check out https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-verilog[neorv32-verilog] for more information.


.GHDL-yosys Plugin
[WARNING]
If you would like to use the experimental GHDL Yosys plugin for VHDL on Linux or MacOS, you will need to set
the `GHDL_PREFIX` environment variable. e.g. `export GHDL_PREFIX=<install_dir>/fpga-toolchain/lib/ghdl`.
On Windows this is not necessary. +
 +
If you are using an existing Makefile set up for ghdl-yosys-plugin and see ERROR: This version of yosys
is built without plugin support you probably need to remove `-m ghdl` from your yosys parameters. This is
because the plugin is typically loaded from a separate file but it is provided built into yosys in this
package. +
- from https://github.com/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain +
 +
**This means you might have to edit the call to yosys in `litex/soc/cores/cpu/neorv32/core.py`.**

[start=3]
. Add the `bin` folder of the ghdl-yosys-plugin to your `PATH` environment variable. You can test your yosys installation
and check for the GHDL plugin:

[source, bash]
----
$ yosys -H

=== LiteX Simulation

Start a simulation right in your console using the NEORV32 as target CPU:

[source, bash]
----
$ litex_sim --cpu-type=neorv32
----

LiteX will start running its BIOS:
